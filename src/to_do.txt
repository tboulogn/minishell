parsing
- check well if the pipe is well places or not
- make a open file functions maybe??
- think about here_doc ->we need to store the limiter somewhere int a structure


-think about EOF , the placement
    ->    <<EOF |cat|grep "hello" this is an error
    -> I should add "LIMMITER" to the token
