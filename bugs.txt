- quotes
    Before, we were checking if the quotes are well closed or not on parsing (parse_token) but
    we can have some valgrind errors since we need to exit there even if we already allocateed 
    some structures.
    -> I changed it so we do it on the syntax error check (heck_syntax_error) BEFORE we actually
        do parsing, so we just print as error if we pass unclosed quotes (This matches to the subject).

    Now, echo "$PATH"'', echo '$PATH'"" are also working.

- still reachable
    - when we pass cmds with pipes but one of them are builtin.
    - when we pass none-exist cmds (with or without pipes).
    - when we do here_doc

- gnl
    - there were some leaks from gnl we had so I chnaged into mine (just in case!)

- dir1
    - I just made this dir to try some cmds with relatibe path so no worries about it!

-_note.c
    - I saved my previous version of some files so I can go back and check if I face some issues haha
