//////DEBUG////////////
- ctrl + \
- cat (without arguments) -> ctrl + C -> behaives strange
- exit + (none numeric character) -> echo $? -> now it is 255 but on bash it is 2 -> I changed it into 2 :)
- export NEW_VAR (without any value) -> env -> we cannot execute some cmds like "clear", it shows "TERM environment variable not set."
    -> Idk if it is important but you can have a look!
- SO PROUD we can do "export VAR1=one VAR2=two VAR3=three"
    -> if you have some time...... maybe you can try the same for unset? "unset VAR1=one VAR2=two VAR3=three"

/////////NOTE//////////
- quotes
    Before, we were checking if the quotes are well closed or not on parsing (parse_token) but
    we can have some valgrind errors since we need to exit there even if we already allocateed 
    some structures.
    -> I changed it so we do it on the syntax error check (heck_syntax_error) BEFORE we actually
        do parsing, so we just print as error if we pass unclosed quotes (This matches to the subject).

    Now, echo "$PATH"'', echo '$PATH'"" are also working.

- still reachable
    - when we pass cmds with pipes but one of them are builtin.
    - when we pass none-exist cmds (with or without pipes).
    - when we do here_doc

- gnl
    - there were some leaks from gnl we had so I chnaged into mine (just in case!)

- dir1
    - I just made this dir to try some cmds with relatibe path so no worries about it!

-_note.c
    - I saved my previous version of some files so I can go back and check if I face some issues haha
